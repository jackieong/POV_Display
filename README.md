### Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a persistence of vision (POV) display, that is, a display that relies on the latency of human vision to create more interesting images than a static display can deliver. The inspiration for this project comes from the art piece Full Turn. This piece takes two LCD screens placed back-to-back and spins them at high speeds. Since this piece utilizes POV and the resolution of these displays is high, very interesting and complex shapes can be displayed. The images created can even look three dimensional.
Since Full Turn is an art piece rather than an engineering project, finding technical specifications on the display proved impossible and the expense of using two large LCD screens is difficult to surmount for someone who just wants to tinker. We created this tutorial to explain how to make a POV display similar to Full Turn with technical specifications and without the high cost.
